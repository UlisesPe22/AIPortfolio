## Projects

Each project is organized within this repository and comes with a dedicated README file. These README files provide in-depth information about each project, including its purpose, technical details, and how to run or utilize the code.

Here's a brief overview of the types of projects you'll find here:

### Personal Projects

1. [GermanVocabulary Webapp](link to project 1 README): I am currently a german language learner and, so I developed this webapp to help me learn vocabulary and gain more coding skills. 

2. [FullstackWebapp architecture]([link to project 2 README](https://github.com/UlisesPe22/Portfolio/blob/main/Cloud%20Computing/FullstackApp%20Architecture/readme.md)): After doing a small project in terraform for my uni, I really found cloud technologies fascinating and I decided to keep on learning.

### University Projects

1. [HabitTrackerApp](link to project 3 README): A brief description of the first university project.

2. [Static Website architecture](link to project 4 README): This was my first approach to cloud computing and Terraform. Although is a simple project, it really helped me understand a lot of basic concepts of cloud computing and networks interaction (among other things). 

Please feel free to explore these projects and their corresponding README files for more detailed information about each one.
